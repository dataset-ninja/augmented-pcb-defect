**Augmented PCB Defect** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the manufacturing industry, and in the damage detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 10668 images with 21664 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *mouse_bite*, *missing_hole*, *spurious_copper*, and other: *spur*, *open_circuit*, and *short*.

Images in the Augmented PCB Defect dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (5120 images), *val* (3414 images), and *test* (2134 images). The dataset was released in 2019 by the Peking University and Shenzhen Skyworth-RGB Electronic, China.
